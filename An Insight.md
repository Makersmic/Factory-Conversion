First let me preface this with that i have built Excel workbooks that i can be proud of.  With the advent of chatgpt though i would like to take my workbooks to the next level.  
This is a project that where i am enlisting chatgpt as my assistant that knows everything technical in terms execution in the Microsoft Excel canvas.  I've come to the conclusion
through a couple of conversations with Chatgpt that it is quite good at providing accurate excel vba code, and in some cases a good imagination for should take place.  With anything
though a person must look at Chatgpt as a tool though and not a cheat.  I have begun a conversation with Chatgpt to help in the tracking of a production floor for a paper conversion
company.  The actual business type may change or morph to be inclusive of other industries, or just modifiable to an extent for that purpose.

I will be asking Chatgpt for assistant in creating various forms within Excel and Access, and along the way probably tack in Adobe Acrobat for its pdf creation abilities.  Now that i
think about Outlook for the emailing capabilities and maybe explore media playback as well.  I'm sure i will learn a lot along the way as i have already with the couple weeks spent using Chatgpt.

Lastly, I lay claim to writing all of the code in that will be written in this repository.  I will do my best to ensure no code is plajurized from another author.

The untimate goal, create a set of workbooks that gives a production manager and any other relating associates the critical knowledge to ensure maximum output of a production floor.
